## Overview

This was one hell of a challenge for me, as I had a pretty difficult time trying to add the filter feature. Getting the layout and making it responsive wasn't a problem. I had to go through the javascript code several times trying to get it to be able filter the data and display the filtered data while still allowing it to be done again. Overall it was a pretty good experience as I had to stretch my thoughts. The filter still isn't fully implemented as it is on the challenge, but I'm still working on it.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

## My process

I tried implementing the filter feature severally using the async function but I just couldn't get it completely right at first. The main difficulty was making it possible for the user to be able to clear a filter and being able to fiter it again.

### Built with

- Tailwind-CSS Flexbox
- Tailwind-CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to properly use async functions, as I finally got to understand where and why I was having the filter problem

### Continued development

I'll continue improving my skills and updating myself, as I have just started learning React
